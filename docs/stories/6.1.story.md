title: "(Technical Task) Scaffold Monorepo and Applications"
status: "Draft"
---

### 1. Goal

To set up the basic file and project structure for the entire application according to the architecture document, so that developers can begin working on features in a clean, organized environment.

### 2. Acceptance Criteria

1.  The root directory is initialized as an `npm workspaces` monorepo.
2.  A new Next.js application is created within `apps/web`.
3.  A new FastAPI application is created within `apps/api`.
4.  A new package for shared TypeScript types is created at `packages/shared-types`.
5.  The frontend app (`apps/web`) has Material-UI (MUI) and Emotion installed as dependencies.
6.  The backend app (`apps/api`) has `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and `pytest` installed as dependencies.

### 3. Dev Notes

#### Technical Context
*   This is a foundational setup task. It should strictly follow the `Repository Structure` and `Technology Stack` sections of the `architecture.md` document.
*   The goal is to create the boilerplate structure so that feature development (from Epic 1 onwards) can begin.

#### File Locations
*   `package.json`: Will be created in the root directory to manage workspaces.
*   `apps/web`: Will contain the Next.js application.
*   `apps/api`: Will contain the FastAPI application.
*   `packages/shared-types`: Will contain a `package.json` and a `tsconfig.json`.

### 4. Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Initialize Monorepo (AC: 1)**
    *   [ ] In the project root, run `npm init -y`.
    *   [ ] Edit the created `package.json` to define the workspaces (e.g., `"workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]`).
2.  **Scaffold Frontend App (AC: 2, 5)**
    *   [ ] Navigate to the `apps` directory.
    *   [ ] Run `npx create-next-app@latest web` to create the Next.js app in the `web` folder.
    *   [ ] In the `apps/web` directory, install MUI: `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`.
3.  **Scaffold Backend App (AC: 3, 6)**
    *   [ ] Create the `apps/api` directory.
    *   [ ] Set up a Python virtual environment for the backend.
    *   [ ] Install dependencies: `pip install fastapi uvicorn pytest`.
    *   [ ] Create a basic `main.py` file with a hello-world FastAPI app.
4.  **Scaffold Shared Package (AC: 4)**
    *   [ ] Create the `packages/shared-types` directory.
    *   [ ] Add a `package.json` and a `tsconfig.json` to this directory to define it as a TypeScript package.
    *   [ ] Create an initial `index.ts` file.
5.  **Verify Workspaces**
    *   [ ] From the root directory, ensure that running `npm install` correctly links the workspaces.

### 5. QA Results
